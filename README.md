# basicRAT

This is a cross-platform Python 2.x Remote Access Trojan (RAT), basicRAT was created to maintain a clean design full-featured Python RAT. Currently a work in progress and still being actively hacked on.

**Disclaimer: This RAT is for research purposes only, and should only be used on authorized systems. Accessing a computer system or network without authorization or explicit permission is illegal.**

## Features
* Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS)
* AES-256 encrypted C2 with D-H exchange
* Accepts connection from multiple clients
* Command execution
* Standard utilities (cat, ls, pwd, unzip, wget)
* System survey
* Self-destruct
* Primitive port scanning
* Client reconnect

## Usage
```
$ python basicRAT_server.py --port 1337

## Build a stand-alone executable
Keep in mind that before building you will likely want to modify both the `HOST` and `PORT` variables located at the top of `basicRAT_client.py` to fit your needs.

On Linux you will need Python 2.x, [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/), and pycrypto. Then run something like `pyinstaller2 --onefile basicRAT_client.py` and it should generate a `dist/` folder that contains a stand-alone ELF executable.

On Windows you will need Python 2.x, PyInstaller, pycrypto, pywin32, and pefile. Then run something like `C:\path\to\PyInstaller-3.2\PyInstaller-3.2\pyinstaller.py --onefile basicRAT_client.py` and it should generate a `dist/` folder that contains a stand-alone PE (portable executable).

## Todo
* Interactive shell
* Client binary generation tool (cross-platform)
  * Pyinstaller
  * Switch options for remote IP, port, etc
* Persistence (cross-platform)
  * Windows: Registry keys, WMIC, Startup Dir
  * Linux: cron jobs, services, modprobe
  * macOS: LaunchAgent, LaunchDaemons
* Privilege Escalation (getsystem-esque, dirty cow)
* Common C2 Protocols (HTTP, DNS)
* Clean log files
    * Linux: bash history, var logs, audit logs, etc
    * Windows: Event logs, prefetch, etc
* Screenshot
* Keylogger
* Expand toolkit (unrar, sysinfo)
* Scanning utilities (probe scan / ping sweep, scanning subnet)
* Password dumping (mimikatz / gsecdump)
* Tunneling / Pivoting (ssh)
* Anti-virus detection and evasion
* VM and Sandbox detection
* Exfil browser history
* Search file system for sensitive information using regex
    * addresses, credit cards numbers, socials, PII, etc
* Detect web cameras and take snapshots
* Steal wifi passwords
